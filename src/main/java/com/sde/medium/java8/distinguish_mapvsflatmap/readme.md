Differences between Java 8 Map() Vs flatMap() :

map()	                                    flatMap()
It processes stream of values.	           It processes stream of stream of values.
It does only mapping.	                   It performs mapping as well as flattening.
It’s mapper function produces 
single value for each input value.	       It’s mapper function produces multiple values for each input value.
It is a One-To-One mapping.	               It is a One-To-Many mapping.
Data Transformation : From Stream to 
Stream	Data Transformation                : From Stream<Stream to Stream
Use this method when the mapper 
function is producing a single value 
for each input value.	                    Use this method when the mapper function is producing multiple values for each input value.


<R> Stream<R> flatMap(Function<? super T, ? extends Stream<? extends R>> mapper);

Returns a stream consisting of the results of replacing each element of this stream
with the contents of a mapped stream produced by applying the provided mapping function 
to each element. Each mapped stream is closed after its contents have been placed into 
this stream. (If a mapped stream is null an empty stream is used, instead.)
This is an intermediate operation.

Params:
mapper – a non-interfering, stateless function to apply to each element which produces 
a stream of new values

Returns:
the new stream
API Note:
The flatMap() operation has the effect of applying a one-to-many transformation to the 
elements of the stream, and then flattening the resulting elements into a new stream.
Examples.
If orders is a stream of purchase orders, and each purchase order contains a collection
of line items, then the following produces a stream containing all the line items in 
all the orders:
orders.flatMap(order -> order.getLineItems().stream())...
If path is the path to a file, then the following produces a stream of the words 
contained in that file:
Stream<String> lines = Files.lines(path, StandardCharsets.UTF_8);  
Stream<String> words = lines.flatMap(line -> Stream.of(line.split(" +")));
The mapper function passed to flatMap splits a line, using a simple regular expression,
into an array of words, and then creates a stream of words from that array.
